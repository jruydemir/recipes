Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 28 oz can refried beans
* [ ] 2 tbsp butter or lard
* [ ] 2 cups sour cream

1. In a medium pot, heat refried beans. Add fat and a few tbsp of water to thin it out. Once fat has fully incorporated, spread beans at the bottom of a pyrex. Set in a fridge to cool.
2. In a bowl, whisk two tbsp water with the sour cream. Set in fridge.
3. In a mixing bowl mix tomatoes, onion, jalapenos, and salt. Set in fridge.
4. Mash avocados, lime, salt, and cilantro. Cover and set in fridge.

Notes
=====

Could also add sliced olives to this, but that could be overkill.
