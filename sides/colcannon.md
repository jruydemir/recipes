Colcannon are irish buttery mashed potatoes with greens. Celery root isn't traditional, but it's a fun additional flavor.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 5 medium yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed
* [ ] 1 head of celery root, peeled and cubed
* [ ] Kosher salt
* [ ] 6 tbsp butter, divided
* [ ] 4 green onions, white parts thinly sliced, greens sliced into 1-inch pieces
* [ ] 1 large bunch kale, stemmed and sliced into 1/2" ribbons
* [ ] 3/4 cup milk
* [ ] 1/2 cup heavy cream
* [ ] Freshly ground black pepper

Preparation
===========
1. In a large pot, cover potatoes and celery root with water and season generously with salt. Bring to a boil and cook until totally soft, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and add to mixing bowl.
2. Meanwhile, melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large pot. Add green onions and garlic and cook until beginning to soften and smell fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add shredded kale. Let cook 4 minutes, mixing often until kale wilts.
3. Mash the potato mixture adding remaining butter, milk, and cream. Once smooth, add sauted vegetables and mix well.
