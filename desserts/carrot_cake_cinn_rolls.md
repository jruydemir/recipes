For the Carrot Cinnamon Rolls

* [ ] 2 carrots, and cut into 1 inch pieces
* [ ] ⅔ cup sugar
* [ ] ½ cup butter, melted
* [ ] 2 eggs, room temperature 
* [ ] 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt 
* [ ] 4 ½ cups flour (585 grams)
* [ ] 2 (2 ¼ ounce) packets instant yeast
* [ ] ½ cup heavy cream 

For the Filling
* [ ] 1 ½ cups butter, softened 
* [ ] 1 ½ cups brown sugar
* [ ] 3 tablespoons cinnamon 
* [ ] 2 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg 
* [ ] 1 teaspoon ground ginger 
* [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cloves

For the Cream Cheese Frosting
* [ ] ¼ cup butter, softened 
* [ ] 16 ounces cream cheese, softened 
* [ ] 16 ounces mascarpone 
* [ ] 1 cup powdered sugar
* [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* [ ] ¼ teaspoon kosher salt 
* [ ] milk


Preparation
===========

1. In a high powered blender, add whole milk and carrots and blend for 1-2 minutes, or until the carrots have completely pureed into the milk. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve and discard the solids. 

2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitting with the dough hook attachment, add flour, salt and yeast together and whisk well. 

3. In a medium heat proof bowl, add the carrot milk, butter and sugar and microwave until the butter has melted and the milk is slightly warmed. It should be no hotter than 105. 

4. Add the warm milk mixture to the dry ingredients and mix on low for 2 minutes. Add 1 egg, allow it to incorporate, then add the second egg. Increase the speed to medium and knead until the dough pulls away from the sides. It may stick to the bottom of the bowl, but that is okay. 

5. Press the dough with 1 finger, if it is tacky, but doesn’t stick to your finger, the dough is done. If it sticks to your finger, add 1 tablespoon of flour and mix again on low. Repeat until the correct consistency is achieved. Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 15 minutes. 

6. While the dough is resting, make the filling. In a medium mixing bowl, add butter and spices and stir to fully combine. Set aside. 

7. Remove the plastic wrap and turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll out into a 12x18 inch rectangle. 

8. Spread the filling from edge to edge, then roll the longest side away from you into a jelly roll shape. Cut into 6 rolls for jumbo rolls, or 12 for medium-sized cinnamon rolls. Lightly grease a metal 9-inch cake pan (or metal/glass 9x13 pan for the 12 rolls) and add the rolls. Cover with plastic wrap and proof for 1-2 hours, or until the cinnamon rolls have doubled in size. 

9. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Place the cinnamon roll pan on a sheet tray. Drizzle heavy cream over rolls and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown. 

10. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack. While the cinnamon rolls are cooling, make the cream cheese frosting. 

11. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add cream cheese, mascarpone and butter. Turn the mixer on low to incorporate, then increase to medium and whip for 1 minute. Once the mixture is paler in color and fluffy, turn the mixer off an add sugar and salt. Whisk on low until incorporated. Add in vanilla extract. the zest of a lemon, and a splash of milk to bring it together. Increase the speed and whip for 1-2 minutes. Set aside. 

12. Once the cinnamon rolls have cooled, slice them in half and spread the frosting in the middle.
