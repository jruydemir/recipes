You ever have stuffed peppers going up? This is the arab version and it's much better IMO.

Ingredients
===========
* [ ] 16 Mexican (grey) squash

* [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1/4 large onion, minced
* [ ] 1 tomato seeded, minced
* [ ] 1 pound ground beef, 80/20
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp 7 Spice (Adalet just uses cumin here)
* [ ] 1 tsp salt 
* [ ] 1/4 tsp black pepper
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups long grain white rice

* [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 cup tomato paste
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
* [ ] 6 garlic cloves pressed
* [ ] 8 cup chicken broth low sodium

Preparation
===========
1. Wash and drain rice. Mix together all stuffing ingredients.
2. On each squash, wash, slice off the top, and core the squash. Keep the walls of the squash pretty thin (~2m). The walls of the squash should bend a little under the pressure when squeezed.
3. Crumble up the stuffing mixture into the squash. IMPORTANT: Do not press the stuffing into the squash. You can shake it a little to let it pack down. Fill up to 1/4" under the top of the squash.
4. In a large pot, add the oil, tomato paste, garlic, salt & pepper. Allow paste to fry for a minute. Add the chicken broth, bring to a boil.
5. Place the squash in the sauce. Cover. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium. Simmer for 45 minutes.
6. Remove lid. Lower heat to low. Let thicken for 30 minutes. 
7. Serve sliced with tomato sauce and a yogurt sauce.

Notes
=====
Can be cooked with lamb chops.

Cook with tomato, not lemon.
