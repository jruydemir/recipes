* [ ] 1 tbsp soy sauce
* [ ] 1 tbsp shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp sesame oil, toasted
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp msg
* [ ] 2 tsp cornstarch
* [ ] 1/8 tsp white pepper, ground

Preparation
===========

Notes
=====

Needs more flavor try dried shrimp (toasted & ground), 

Serve with fresh ginger, chile oil, soy sauce, and dark vinegar.
