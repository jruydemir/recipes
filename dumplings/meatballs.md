These are a great thing to make ahead and have an easy meal later. I usually double this recipe and freeze the meatballs. They only need about 10-15 min to cook.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 yellow onion, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 1/2 bunch parsley, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 1 lb ground beef, 15% fat
* [ ] 1 lb italian sausage
* [ ] 1 lg egg
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup bread crumbs, usually panko
* [ ] 1 handful fresh shredded parm
* [ ] 2-3 tbsp milk
* [ ] 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper
* [ ] 1.2 tsp salt
* [ ] pinch msg

Preparation
===========
1. In a food processor, mince chopped onion. Scrape sides several times. Squeeze out excess onion juices. Add parsley and garlic, and continue to mince veggies.
2. In a large mixing bowl add beef, pork, minced aromatics, and all remaining ingredients. Mix by hand until homogenous. Cover and let sit in fridge for 20 minutes.
3. Line baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out mix into meatballs about 1 1/4" in diameter and place on parchment.*
4. Once baking sheet is full you can put it directly in the freezer for about an hour. After that place meatballs in freezer bag and back in the freezer overnight.
5. When you're ready to cook.** Preheat oven to 400F. Bake on a wire rack over cookie sheet for 12 minutes. Be sure to temp test to make sure they're fully cooked.

Notes
=====
\* Size is more preference based for the meatballs. Just know that larger meatballs will take longer to cook. Be sure to use a meat thermometer and bring the middle of the meatballs to 165F degrees.

** We prefer to make these in the air fryer or convection oven for better browning.

Get weight for parm. That'll be more accurate.
