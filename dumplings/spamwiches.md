We have a street food restaurant in Seattle called Marination Station. They do korean fusion food and  it's the best. This is my take on their spam sandwich

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 can Spam (25% less Sodium)
* [ ] 1 12 pack Hawaiian sweet rolls
* [ ] 1/2 small cabbage, shredded
* [ ] 1 lg carrot, shredded
* [ ] 1 small dikon radish, shredded
* [ ] 3 green onions, sliced
* [ ] 1/4 cup rice vinegar
* [ ] 2 tsp soy sauce
* [ ] 1 tsp sugar
* [ ] 1 tsp sesame oil
* [ ] 1/4 cup mayo
* [ ] 1-2 tsp siracha

Preparation
===========
1. Slice the spam in to 6-8 slices (I prefer 8).
2. Remove the roles and slice horizontally down the middle.
3. In a bowl, mix cabbage, carrot, radish, green onion, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil. Set aside.
4. In a small bowl mix mayo and siracha
5. In a hot pan fry up spam. Brown nicely on each side. 
6. Take 2-4 squares of rolls at a time. Fry them on the hot pan until lightly browned. 
7. Assemble sandwiches in the following order. Two attached squares of hawaiian roll (bottom), siracha mayo, slice of spam, generous pile of slaw, top of hawaiian roll.

ENJOY
