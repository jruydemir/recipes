One of my favorite parts of being in turkey is the fresh börek everywhere you go. Crunchy and flaky with filling. It's tough to beat. This recipe is my preferred filling, but can have many types of fillings.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 pkg filo sheets (count 36)
* [ ] 2 med russet potatoes
* [ ] 1 medium onion, fine dice
* [ ] 10 oz spinach
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 tsp pepper
* [ ] 8 oz feta, preferably fresh
* [ ] 1/2 butter/olive oil
* [ ] 4 tbsp yogurt
* [ ] 4 tbsp milk
* [ ] 1 egg, whisked
* [ ] Sesame and Nigella seeds (optional)

Preparation
===========
1. The night before place filo sheets in the fridge to thaw. Filo needs at least 3 hours at room temp.
2. Start boiling water and add potatoes whole. Simmer for an hour until soft.
3. Saute the onions with a tbsp of oil. After about 5 minutes add the spinach. Once wilted add salt and pepper, turn heat to low. Occasionally stir mixture and allow liquid to evaporate for 15-20 min.
4. In med bowl, add spinach and allow to cool. Crumble feta and mix well.
5. When potatoes are ready, peel slice and let cool.
6. Half finely chop, half mash potatoes. You want some small chunks. Mix into spinach.
7. In a small bowl mix oil, yogurt, and milk.
8. Form the borek by laying 1 sheet of filo, brush with yogurt mixture and repeat for 3 layers total.
9. Lay a 1/2" tube of the spinach mixture along the shorter edge of the borek. Roll up and place on parchment paper lined baking sheet.
10. Repeat with remaining filling.
11. Brush borek with egg. Sprinkle with sesame and nigella.
12. Bake at 350F for 30-40 minutes until browned and crispy.

Notes
=====

* Only made this once before, proportions may need editing.
* Alt fillings include just spinach and cheese, just potatoes, or ground beef. Have fun with it.
