OMG I think I finally have a recipe I think is worth it.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 4 roma tomatoes
* [ ] 2 guajillo peppers
* [ ] 1 chile arbol
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic (skin on)
* [ ] 1/3 large onion
* [ ] 1/2 tsp. chicken bouillion
* [ ] 1/4 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1/4 tsp mexican oregano
* [ ] 1/4 tsp ezpazote
* [ ] salt, pepper, sugar to taste

* [ ] 1/2 lg pack of corn tortillas
* [ ] frying oil

Preparation
===========
1. In a med pot boil tomatoes, peppers and garlic for 10 minutes. 
2. Once the tomatoes are soft, remove them and the garlic. Leave the peppers off heat.
3. Blend the tomatoes, garlic (skins off), and peppers. Add most of the onion, boullion, cumin, oregano, ezpazote, salt, pepper, and sugar with 3/4 cup water. Continue to blend well for a few minutes. Let rest for 20 min, then strain.
4. Thinly slice remaining onion and fry in a bit of canola oil. Add strained sauce and fry. Bring to a simmer and take off heat.
5. Batch fry tortillas until crispy. Then in a large hot pan pour sauce over tortillas. Fry and reduce until the correct consistency. Chips should hold up, but look soft with a slight crunch.

Serve with queso, crema, cilantro, green onion, eggs.

Notes
=====
Serve with eggs, thin shaved beef, refried beans.

Top with queso, crema, avacado, cilantro

Maybe try searing the onion on a dry pan.

try morina or new mexico chile added
