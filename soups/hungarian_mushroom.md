2. Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and stir in the flour, constantly whisking for several minutes until the mixture is a rich, caramelized brown. Add the milk, broth, and soy sauce, still whisking until the mixture is smooth and starting to thicken.
3. Add Roux to Mushroom mixture. Add salt, pepper, and dill. Bring to a boil and cook for 15 minutes.
