One of my favorite simple meals to eat.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 4 cups chicken stock
* [ ] 1/2 tsp sesame oil
* [ ] 3/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/8 tsp sugar
* [ ] 1/8 tsp white pepper
* [ ] 1/4 tsp turmeric
* [ ] 3 tbsp cornstarch (mixed with 1/3 cup water)
* [ ] 3 eggs
* [ ] 1 scallion
* [ ] 1/4 tsp MSG 

Preparation
===========

1. Beat the egg in a bowl until well mixed. In a separate bowl, combine the corn starch with the cold water and stir to dissolve.
2. Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, MSG, and tumeric.
3. Add the cornstarch and water mixture. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry. Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup.
4. Lightly whisk the egg so that some whites are still visible. Give the soup a stir, stop stirring and slowly pour in egg a little bit at a time. Count to 3, stir and repeat until all egg is added.
