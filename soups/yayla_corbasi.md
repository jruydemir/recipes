This soup is something Tarik's mom makes us when we visit. Oh man is it good. Home-y and warm. Instant comfort. This is something I will crave next time I'm sick.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 8 cups chicken stock or canned low-sodium broth
* [ ] 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup water
* [ ] 3/4 cup basmati rice (baldo is preferred, but anything will work)
* [ ] 2 cups full-fat plain yogurt
* [ ] 2 large egg yolk
* [ ] 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* [ ] 3 garlic cloves, grated
* [ ] 1 15oz can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* [ ] 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] Salt and freshly ground pepper
* [ ] 4 tablespoons olive oil or butter 
* [ ] 2 teaspoons aleppo or marash pepper
* [ ] 2 tablespoons finely chopped mint

Preparation
===========
1. Bring chicken stock to a boil add chicken breast and cook for 25-30 min until fully cooked and shreddable. Remove chicken. Keep broth at a low simmer.
2. Rinse rice. Bring water to a boil. Add the rice, cover, and cook on low for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. In a separate bowl, mix yogurt, yolk, flour and garlic. Set aside.
4. Add rice, chickpeas, and shredded chicken to the broth. Slowly add hot broth two tbsp at a time to the yogurt mixture and mix well until volume is roughly double. Add yogurt mixture to broth.
5. In a side pan heat up oil. Add mint while still relatively cool, once sizzling add the aleppo and fry for 30 seconds. Add most of the oil to the pot and mix.
6. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve topped with a bit of the hot oil on top.

Notes

Still a WIP but it already tastes really good.
