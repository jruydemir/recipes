Jook is another word for congee (rice porridge)

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 1/2 cups short grain rice, rinsed and drained
* [ ] 12 cups chicken broth
* [ ] ginger, to taste
* [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
* [ ] 1/2 tsp white pepper
* [ ] 1/2 tsp msg

* [ ] 1 lb ground pork
* [ ] 1 tbsp oyster sauce
* [ ] 1 tsp soy sauce
* [ ] 2 garlic cloves
* [ ] 1/2 tsp white pepper, ground
* [ ] 2 tbsp cilantro, minced

* [ ] 7 baby bok choi
* [ ] green onions, sliced

Preparation
===========
1. In a hot medium pot, add a little oil and toast the rice. Don't come for me with not traditional, it tastes good. Add broth ginger, soy, white pepper, and msg. Bring to a slight simmer
2. Combined all ingredients for meatballs into a medium bowl. Mix using chopsticks, stirring in one direction. You want to develop a lot of protein strands. Set aside.
3. Form into meatballs with about the diameter of a nickel.
4. At this point the rice should be soft. Use a whisk to break the rice, stirring quickly for about 1 minute. Turn heat down to low.
5. Separate the greens of the bok choi from the stems. Slice the leaves about a 1/4 inch thick. Slice the stems about 1/8th in thick. 
6. Add the meatballs gently to the porridge, let cook for 2 minutes then add the sliced up stems. Gently stir. Let cook for another 5 minutes, then add the leaves and green onions.

Notes
=====
I want to play with heat, and perhaps mushrooms in this recipe as well.
