Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 4 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 medium onion, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 2 medium carrots, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 1 medium potato, peeled, coarsely chopped
* [ ] 1 tbsp tomato paste
* [ ] 1 tbsp pepper paste
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 3 tsp mint
* [ ] 2 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1/2 tsp tumeric
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup red lentils, rinsed
* [ ] 4 cups veggie or chicken broth
* [ ] 1 heaping tbsp bullion
* [ ] Boiling water to get to consistency

Preparation
===========
1. In a big pot over medium heat, add olive oil. Once hot add onion, garlic, carrots, and potato. Saute for about 5 minutes. Until onions start to become translucent. Don't let them brown.
2. Add tomato paste, and pepper paste to the pot. Stir and let fry for about a minute. Add all the spices. Fry for a minute. Add lentils and cook for a few minutes to let the lentils cook a bit without moisture.
3. Add the broth and bullion. Add about 2 cups of water and reserve more in case it's too thick. Cover and bring to a simmer for 45 minutes. If using a pressure cooker, pressure cook for 15 minutes and allow to naturally vent.
4. Using an immersion blender, puree for several minutes until very smooth.
5. Serve with bread and aleppo pepper oil.

Notes
=====

Trust the veggie sizes. Don't go too big. It changes the flavor.
