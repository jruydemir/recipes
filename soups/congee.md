This is such a comforting meal, especially if you're sick. This version is a bit of a cheaters version. Not authentic preparation.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 1/2 cups short grain rice, rinsed, exact amount
* [ ] 10 cups water
* [ ] 1.5-2 lbs bone in chicken legs
* [ ] 2 tbsp soy sauce
* [ ] 4 tbsp chicken bouillon
* [ ] 35g knob of ginger, peeled, thick sliced
* [ ] 4-6 green onions
* [ ] 2 tsp sesame oil

Preparation
===========
1. Combined rice, water, whole chicken, soy sauce, bouillon, and ginger into a rice cooker. Start rice cooker on the soup setting.
2. thinly slice green onions, separating the greens from white slices. Add the white slices to the pot.
3. Bring congee to a boil and simmer for 30 minutes.
4. When complete, pull out chicken, let cool and pull apart into chunks. Discard the bones, skin, and unwanted parts.
5. Using whisk or chopsticks gently but rapidly stir soup. You're breaking up the rice to allow the soup to thicken quicker. Don't over whisk. Whisk for a full minute. Then let the soup simmer for 10 minutes.
6. Stir soup again, bottom should be pretty thick. If the resulting consistency is thick enough, proceed to step 7. If not, repeat step 5.
7. Remove the ginger slices. Add the chicken, remaining green onions slices, and sesame oil. Stir well. Serve

Notes
