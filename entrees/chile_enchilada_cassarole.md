Oh so delicious.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 8 lg eggs
* [ ] 1 1/2 sour cream
* [ ] 1 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 2 15 oz can verde enchilada sauce
* [ ] 1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped
* [ ] 1 bunch green onion, chopped
* [ ] 2 small cans roasted green chiles
* [ ] 14 oz monterey jack cheese, shredded
* [ ] 20 corn tortillas, cut in half

Preparation
===========
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. In a large bowl whisk eggs until smooth. Add cumin, pepper, and salt. Mix in sour cream, then mix in verde enchilada sauce. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl mix together cilantro, green onions, and roasted chiles.
4. In a hot pan, spray a little bit of oil down. Working in batches lightly toast tortillas in the pan. This is an optional step, but I do think it improves the flavor.
5. Lightly oil the bottom and sides of a pyrex. Place a layer of tortillas (should take 10 halves). Sprinkle a quarter of the cilantro mix and a quarter of the cheese. Pour about a quarter of the egg mixture. Then repeat for 3 more layers.
6. Bake for 45 minutes. Until top is lightly browned and middle is fully cooked.

Notes
=====

Work in progress here. I upped the salt for flavor. Regardless it's really good.
