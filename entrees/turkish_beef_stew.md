This hearty stew (there's probably a better name for it) is a common meal in turkey. It's served over rice and very delicious.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 2 lbs beef chuck, cleaned and cubed small
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 tsp beef
* [ ] 2 cups water
* [ ] 1 lb sliced crimini mushrooms
* [ ] 1 lg onion, diced
* [ ] 4 aneheim peppers, cleaned and sliced into half moons
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic
* [ ] 1/2 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1/2 tsp paprika
* [ ] 1 tsp pepper paste
* [ ] 1 tsp tomato paste
* [ ] 2 tbsp flour
* [ ] 1 tsp oregano
* [ ] 1 tsp aleppo pepper (sub half red pepper flakes)
* [ ] 1 can diced tomatoes

Preparation
===========
0. (OPTIONAL) Reserve the fat trimmings from the beef chuck. Heat up the pot and brown the trimmings well to render the fat. Place the remove the trimmings and set aside. You can optionally mince the trimmings and add them back to the pot after adding water. This adds more flavor and you won't notice minced pieces of fat.
1. In a hot pot add a few tbsp of oil (if not using rendered fat). Working in batches brown the beef well. Strain, set aside and complete remaining beef.
2. Once complete pour remaining oil into a pan, set aside. Put the browned beef (and optional trimmings) into the pot. Add water, salt. & pepper. Bring to a slight simmer, lower heat, and cover to simmer for 30 minutes.
3. In the oiled pan, on high heat brown the mushrooms well. Set mushrooms aside once done and add onion and peppers. You may need to add a little more oil at this point. Brown slightly before adding the garlic, cumin, and paprika. Saute for 30 seconds before adding pepper and tomato paste. Saute another 30 seconds. Lower heat, add flour, and cook for a minute. Add mixture to mushrooms. Deglaze the pan with 1 cup water. Add to bowl of veggies.
4. At this point hopefully 30 minutes have passed on the beef braising. Test a piece of beef. It shouldn't fall apart yet, but it shouldn't be chewy. If at that stage or more tender, add the veggies and stir well. Add oregano, aleppo pepper, and diced tomatoes. Add more water if necessary to just cover the top of the solids. Bring back to a simmer and cover. Now is a good time to start some basmati rice.
5. Cook for another 25 min (less if the beef was more tender). Test the beef again. Keep checking every 5-10 min until beef is desired tenderness.

Serve with basmati rice


Notes
=====

WIP - But this is super good. I increased the peppers because more would be nice. Honestly could increase everything but the beef. Seems like a lot of meat.
