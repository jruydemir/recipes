This hearty stew (there's probably a better name for it) is a common meal in turkey. It's served over rice and very delicious.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 2 lbs beef chuck, cleaned and cubed small
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 tsp pepper
* [ ] 2 cups water
* [ ] 1 can diced tomatoes
* [ ] 1 lb sliced crimini mushrooms
* [ ] 1 lg onion, diced
* [ ] 5 anaheim peppers, cleaned and sliced into half moons
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic
* [ ] 1/2 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1/2 tsp paprika
* [ ] 1 tsp pepper paste (optional, but adds the authentic flavor)
* [ ] 1 tsp tomato paste
* [ ] 2 tbsp flour
* [ ] 1 tsp oregano
* [ ] 1 tsp aleppo pepper (sub half red pepper flakes)

Preparation
===========
0. (OPTIONAL) Reserve the fat trimmings from the beef chuck. Heat up the pot and brown the trimmings well to render the fat. Place the remove the trimmings and set aside. You can optionally mince the trimmings and add them back to the pot after adding water. This adds more flavor and you won't notice minced pieces of fat.
1. Airfry peppers whole for 10-12 minutes until skin is blistered, place in a container with lid to sweat them out.
2. In a hot pot add a few tbsp of oil (if not using rendered fat). Working in batches brown the beef  very well. Strain, set aside and complete remaining beef.
3. Once complete pour remaining oil into a pan, set aside. Put the browned beef (and optional trimmings) into the pot. Add water, diced tomatoes, salt. & pepper. Bring to a slight simmer, lower heat, and cover to simmer for 30 minutes.
4. In the oiled pan, on high heat brown the mushrooms well. Set mushrooms aside once done and add onions. You may need to add a little more oil at this point. Brown slightly before adding the garlic, cumin, and paprika. Saute for 30 seconds before adding pepper and tomato paste. Saute another 30 seconds. Lower heat, add flour, and cook for a minute. Add mixture to mushrooms. Deglaze the pan with 1 cup water. Add to bowl of veggies.
5. Peel the skin off the peppers, stem and deseed. Dice and add to to veggies.
6. At this point hopefully 30 minutes have passed on the beef braising. Test a piece of beef. It shouldn't fall apart yet, but it shouldn't be chewy. If at that stage or more tender, add the veggies and stir well. Add oregano, and aleppo pepper. Add more water if necessary to just cover the top of the solids. Bring back to a simmer and cover. Now is a good time to start some basmati rice.
7. Cook for another 25 min (less if the beef was more tender). Test the beef again. Keep checking every 5-10 min until beef is desired tenderness.

Serve with basmati rice

Notes
=====

WIP - But this is super good. I increased the peppers because more would be nice. Honestly could increase everything but the beef. Seems like a lot of meat.
