2. Heat an extra large pan, or large pot. Dry roast 1/2 the onion, jalapenos, tomatoes and garlic until all sides are lightly browned. 

3. Remove the skins of the garlic and stem of the jalapeno. As is, the whole unseeded jalapeno will result in a slightly spicy. Remove seeds as deired before transferring all veggies to the blender. Add soy, boullion, and oregano and blend well. Add water to the 5 cup mark.

4. In the large pan or pot, cook the chicken in a few tbsp oil over high heat. When the chicken is slightly blackened, flip. Set aside.

5. Dice up the other onion and add to the pan. Then the rinced rice. Toast the rice well. Lower the heat. Add the sauce in the blender, as well as the frozen veggies. Mix well, place chicken over the rice. When the liquid begins to boil, turn the heat down to very low, and cover.

6. Let simmer for 30 minutes. Take off the heat and let rest another 10 minutes.
