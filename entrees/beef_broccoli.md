Very much a work in progress. This is the base recipe, but I've had a lot of success thus far.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] ⅓ cup Shaoxing rice wine, dry sherry or sake
* [ ] 3 tbsp plus 2 tsp soy sauce
* [ ] 1 tbsp cornstarch
* [ ] 1 pound beef — chuck or rib steak — sliced thin against the grain
* [ ] ¼ cup oyster sauce
* [ ] ½ tbsp chile-garlic sauce, or to taste
* [ ] ½ cup plus 1 tbsp neutral oil
* [ ] 3 small heads broccoli
* [ ] 2 tbsp unsalted butter



Preparation
===========
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the wine, 2 tbsp of the soy sauce and the cornstarch. Add the beef to the bowl, and toss to combine, then cover the bowl, and set aside for 20 min.

2. Mix remaining soy sauce, the oyster sauce and the chile-garlic sauce, and mix to combine, then add a tbsp of water and mix again. Set aside.

3. Heat the ½ cup of oil in a wok set over high heat. When the oil is hot and shimmering, add about half the beef to the wok, and stir-fry until it is browned and crisp and barely cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl or plate, and set aside. Then repeat with remaining beef.

4. Pour off the oil in the wok, wipe it out with a towel and return it to the stove over high heat. Add the remaining tbsp oil, and swirl it around and heat it until it is smoking. Add the broccoli and cook, tossing and stirring frequently, until lightly charred in spots, about 2 minutes.

5. Add 2 tbsps water to the wok, and toss and stir the broccoli in the steam for an additional 2 minutes, then return beef to the wok, followed by the sauce. Cook, stirring and tossing frequently, for 30 seconds or so, then add the butter, and stir and toss again for 30 seconds more. Serve immediately, with rice.
