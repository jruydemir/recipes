Preparation
===========
Optional Step: In a small pot heat the shrimp shells for a few minutes. Add the chicken broth. Bring to a boil. Take off heat. When you need to add the chicken broth, strain out the shells. This adds a nice seafood flavor to the sauce.

1. Start boiling a large pot of salted water.

2. In pan over high heat, add oil and shrimp. Saute for 1 minute. Flip shrimp over and cook another minute. Ideally you'll see a bit of browning, but take off even if you don't. Don't overcook. Set shrimp aside. 

3. Drizzle pan with a little more olive oil, add sausage and brown until nicely caramelized on both sides, about 4 - 5 minutes. Set aside.

4. Add a bit more olive oil to the pan, add the onion, bell pepper. Saute until soft and slightly browned. Lower heat to medium. Add cajun seasoning, and garlic. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 

5. Add flour to the pan and saute for a few minutes to cook the flour.

6. Add chicken broth mix and scrape to deglaze pan. Add tomatoes. Heat until thicc.

7. Cook pasta in boiling water according to directions.

8. Once the veggies are simmering, add cream and parmesan and stir into sauce. When Parmesan is blended in, add cooked pasta and sausage and stir to combine and heat through, 2 - 3 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste and then lastly, add shrimp.

9. Serve with chopped parsley.
